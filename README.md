# The Violence Crisis in Mexico: Public Perceptions of Safety Alongside Border Apprehensions
This project compares data on violent crimes and the population's perception of danger across different Mexican states, with data on Border Patrol appprehensions along the southern border -- all across the past 20 years, or the generally understood duration of the Mexican crisis with cartel and gang violence. <br> There are visualizations of actual crimes committed across type (homicide, femicide, hostage situations, torture, et cetera) in each Mexican state over time, along with maps of which states have had the most problems over time. This is held side-by-side with visualizations of how the public's perception of danger and insecurity have changed in these states over time. 
Additionally, there are visualizations of Border Patrol apprehensions along the southern border of family units, unaccompanied children, and single adults over time. The goal is not necessarily to find correlation, but just to spot trends. 
There are many reasons that surround cartel violence and its effects that result in rises of attempts for illegal immigration.
